# Quasi-Enterprise JupyterHub Deployment

Welcome to a small project that enables an aspiring person to run a
"Science Platform" suitable for astrophysics research. This might be overkill
if all you need is a local JupyterLab notebook with Python 3.7 (and the amazing
astronomy and processing libraries). However, if you want to leverage more of
an ecosystem around those components with JupyterHub then this can be a
springboard to launch your own project.

If you're looking for a large enterprise-scale JupyterHub deployment running on
Kubernetes then checkout [Zero-to-JupyterHub
with k8s](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

### Spin-up a JupyterHub server with these features
* Reverse-Proxy
* Industry-standard SSO Authentication
* SQL database for persistent configurations and for SQL-based workflows
* Mock S3 object store
* Full-suite of the common Python astrophysics & astronomical libraries
* Spark processing cluster (future)

Loosely based on the documented [JupyterHub
deployment](https://github.com/defeo/jupyterhub-docker/) at [UniversitÃ© de
Versailles](https://jupyter.ens.uvsq.fr/) which is described in depth in
[this blog post](https://opendreamkit.org/2018/10/17/jupyterhub-docker/).

Additionally look up the official [JupyterHub Docker
Deploy](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-deploy-docker) for more
JupyterHub+Docker information.

### All-ðŸŒŸ projects making this demonstration possible
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org)
* [Python](https://www.python.org)
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org)
* [Zenko CloudServer](https://s3-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub)


## Features


### Adapt to your needs

This deployment is ready for you to explore. But if you want to clone and roll
on your own server read below!


_Disclaimer: ensure you understand the well-written by outdated [blog
post](https://opendreamkit.org/2018/10/17/jupyterhub-docker/) first,
to be sure you understand the configuration._

Then, if you like, clone this repository and look into making (at least) the
following changes:

- In [`.env`](.env), set the variable `HOST` to the name of the server you
  intend to host your deployment on.
- In [`reverse-proxy/traefik.toml`](reverse-proxy/traefik.toml), edit
  the paths in `certFile` and `keyFile` and point them to your own TLS
  certificates. Possibly edit the `volumes` section in the
  `reverse-proxy` service in
  [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml).
- In
  [`jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py`](jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py),
  edit the *"Authenticator"* section according to your authentication server.
  If in doubt, [read
  here](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started/authenticators-users-basics.html).

Other changes you may like to make:

- Edit [`jupyterlab/Dockerfile`](jupyterlab/Dockerfile) to include different
  software you like. Do not forget to change
  [`jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py`](jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py)
  accordingly, in particular the *"user data persistence"* section.

## Run!

Once you are ready, build and launch the application with:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
Then navigate to [jupyterhub.docker.localhost](http://jupyterhub.docker.localhost/)
(Google Chrome might work better than other browsers, YMMV)

## Stop

```
docker-compose down
```

Read the [Docker Compose manual](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to
learn how to manage your application.
